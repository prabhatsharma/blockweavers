In a country where insurance penetration is just over 4% (3.8 for life and rest for non-life) , building digital insurance systems make a lot of sense. While there has been explosion in digital insurance in the last two years, the design of insurance has more or less remained the same-it’s still a push product and remains one of the toughest products to sell requiring a lot of anxiety marketing.

What has the digital onslaught brought in, is the efficiency angle-massive inefficiencies in onboarding, claims verification, claims payments and renewals are being reviewed and fast tracked either through AI or blockchain. Most of them are work in progress.

Blockweavers Technologies (BT), an insurance focused start-up, is working on redesigning insurance from scratch, challenging the very notion of how insurance has worked in the commercial world. 

At BT we feel that current models of insurance suffer from a massive design issue and the digital era of AI and Machine learning offers us immense potential to rethink the design, of making insurance a true protection product rather than an investment product-of making insurance a social impact product rather than socially exclusive product.

We are looking for minds who love design thinking and technology ,who have a penchant of seeing the world through a different pair of eyes- for whom coding, tech is an art! 

Its not just a learning formality but a chance to work on developing an insurance prototype that will change how insurance is done in India and elsewhere. 

Join us to understand what we are talking about and see if we can work together!
